# Gamma_Function
Interactive plot to understand the gamma function.

Two matplotlib sliders allow the user to adjust the approximation of the factorial of a chosen value between 0 and 20.
The function itself becomes very large very quick, so a total area between 0 and 100 was chosen which comfortably fits 20 factorial.
